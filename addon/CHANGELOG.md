# Changelog

## 0.1.9

- Fix: media-player album art now loads in both direct-HA and add-on installs. Cosmos proxies HA media URLs through `/api/ha-media/*` so the browser doesn't need to reach HA directly. Bare entity_id values returned by some Sonos/Cast players are dropped instead of 404'ing.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-04

Initial release.

- Scenes with widgets (clock, weather, type-aware entity tiles), backgrounds (solid + animated gradient), per-scene typography, global safe-area padding.
- Transition engine: 6 built-in transitions, per-scene defaults, explicit overrides.
- Reactive HA entity-driven scene push.
- MQTT discovery + command topics for messages and scene activation.
- Sidebar panel admin editor at `/admin`.
